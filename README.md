# PHYS10362-Introduction-to-Programming

This repository contains code that Kento Shiba wrote for a programming course taught at the University of Manchester.

It is meant to push students to learn how to debug, and write code from scratch assuming no previous experience. 

There were two assignments that this culminated in: 
1. To simulate the behavior of a bouncy ball as it fell to the ground.

2. To use nuclear physics theory to find the decay rates among other parameters of experimental data regarding Rubidium and Strontium.
